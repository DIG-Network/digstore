**Authors:** DIG Network  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** September 2025  

## Abstract

This paper presents a novel zero-knowledge content-addressable storage system that enables secure, privacy-preserving data storage on untrusted infrastructure. The system employs URN-based encryption, cryptographic address transformation, and deterministic decoy data generation to ensure that storage providers cannot determine which content exists, cannot decrypt stored data, and cannot distinguish between valid and invalid access attempts. This creates a truly zero-knowledge storage layer suitable for distributed, censorship-resistant, and privacy-preserving applications.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Traditional content-addressable storage systems suffer from several privacy and security limitations:

- **Content Enumeration**: Storage providers can determine which content exists by observing access patterns
- **Metadata Leakage**: File names, sizes, and access frequencies are visible to storage providers
- **Censorship Vulnerability**: Specific content can be selectively blocked or removed
- **Privacy Compromise**: User access patterns and content preferences are exposed

### 1.2 Proposed Solution

We present a zero-knowledge content-addressable storage system with the following properties:

- **Content Privacy**: All data is encrypted using URN-derived keys
- **Address Obfuscation**: Storage addresses are cryptographically transformed
- **Access Indistinguishability**: Invalid requests return decoy data instead of errors
- **Publisher Isolation**: Different publishers store content at different addresses
- **Enumeration Resistance**: Storage providers cannot determine which content exists

### 2.2 Data Flow Overview

1. **Storage Phase**: `Client → Transformation Layer → Storage`
2. **Retrieval Phase**: `Storage → Transformation Layer → Client`
3. **Decoy Generation**: `Invalid Request → Deterministic Random Data → Client`

## 3. Cryptographic Primitives

### 3.1 Key Derivation

The system employs two distinct key derivation methods:

#### Encryption Key Derivation
```
Encryption_Key = SHA256(URN)
```
- **Input**: Raw URN string
- **Output**: 256-bit AES-GCM encryption key
- **Purpose**: Encrypt/decrypt content using original URN

#### Storage Address Derivation
```
Storage_Address = SHA256(transform(URN + Public_Key))
```
- **Input**: URN + Publisher's public key
- **Transform**: Cryptographic transformation combining inputs
- **Output**: 256-bit storage address (as hex string)
- **Purpose**: Zero-knowledge content addressing

### 3.2 URN Transformation Function

```rust
fn transform(urn: String, public_key: PublicKey) -> String {
    let mut hasher = SHA256::new();
    
    // Domain separation
    hasher.update(b"digstore_urn_transform_v1:");
    
    // Add public key
    hasher.update(&public_key.algorithm.as_bytes());
    hasher.update(&(public_key.bytes.len() as u32).to_le_bytes());
    hasher.update(&public_key.bytes);
    
    // Add URN
    hasher.update(&(urn.len() as u32).to_le_bytes());
    hasher.update(urn.as_bytes());
    
    // Return raw hex string (not URN format)
    hex::encode(hasher.finalize())
}
```

### 3.3 Deterministic Decoy Generation

#### 3.3.1 Realistic Size Generation

To ensure decoys are indistinguishable from real content, the system generates deterministic random file sizes that follow realistic file size distributions:

```rust
fn generate_deterministic_random_size(seed: &str) -> usize {
    let mut hasher = SHA256::new();
    hasher.update(seed.as_bytes());
    hasher.update(b"size_generation");
    let hash = hasher.finalize();
    
    let mut bytes = [0u8; 8];
    bytes.copy_from_slice(&hash[0..8]);
    let random_value = u64::from_le_bytes(bytes);
    
    // Realistic file size distribution:
    // 40% small files (1KB - 100KB)
    // 35% medium files (100KB - 1MB) 
    // 20% large files (1MB - 10MB)
    // 5% very large files (10MB - 20MB)
    
    let size_category = random_value % 100;
    match size_category {
        0..=39 => /* 1KB - 100KB */,
        40..=74 => /* 100KB - 1MB */,
        75..=94 => /* 1MB - 10MB */,
        _ => /* 10MB - 20MB */
    }
}
```

#### 3.3.2 Deterministic Data Generation

```rust
fn generate_decoy_data(seed: String, size: usize) -> Vec<u8> {
    let mut result = Vec::with_capacity(size);
    let mut hasher = SHA256::new();
    hasher.update(seed.as_bytes());
    let mut counter = 0u64;
    
    while result.len() < size {
        let mut current_hasher = hasher.clone();
        current_hasher.update(&counter.to_le_bytes());
        let hash = current_hasher.finalize();
        
        let bytes_needed = size - result.len();
        let bytes_to_copy = bytes_needed.min(hash.len());
        result.extend_from_slice(&hash[..bytes_to_copy]);
        
        counter += 1;
    }
    
    result
}
```

## 4. Client-Side Operations

### 4.1 Client Knowledge Requirements

The client must possess:
- **URN**: The Uniform Resource Name identifying the desired content
- **Publisher's Public Key**: Used for address transformation
- **Storage Endpoint**: Location of the zero-knowledge storage provider

### 4.2 Content Storage Workflow

```
1. Client has content and URN
2. Derive encryption key: SHA256(URN)
3. Encrypt content using AES-256-GCM with derived key
4. Transform URN with public key to get storage address
5. Store encrypted blob at transformed address
6. Storage provider receives encrypted data at opaque address
```

**Example:**
```bash
# Client-side operations
URN = "urn:dig:chia:store123/documents/report.pdf"
Public_Key = "abcdef1234567890..."
Encryption_Key = SHA256(URN)
Storage_Address = SHA256(transform(URN + Public_Key))

# Storage provider sees:
# - Address: "7a2c8f9e3b1d5a4c..."  (opaque hex string)
# - Data: [encrypted blob]         (undecryptable without URN)
```

### 4.3 Content Retrieval Workflow

```
1. Client knows URN and public key
2. Transform URN with public key to get storage address  
3. Request content from storage provider using transformed address
4. Receive encrypted blob (or decoy data if invalid)
5. Decrypt using original URN-derived key
6. Verify content authenticity
```

## 5. Storage Provider Operations

### 5.1 Storage Provider Knowledge Limitations

The storage provider has:
- **Encrypted Blobs**: Undecryptable without original URN
- **Opaque Addresses**: Cannot be correlated with original URNs
- **No Metadata**: No file names, sizes, or content information

The storage provider cannot:
- **Decrypt Content**: No access to URN-derived encryption keys
- **Enumerate Valid Content**: Invalid addresses return decoy data
- **Correlate Publishers**: Different public keys create different addresses
- **Determine Content Types**: All data appears as encrypted blobs

### 5.2 Request Handling

```
For any address request:
1. Check if address exists in storage
2. If exists: Return encrypted blob
3. If not exists: Generate deterministic decoy data
4. Return data (never return errors that reveal non-existence)
```

**Critical Property**: Storage provider cannot distinguish between:
- Valid addresses with real encrypted content
- Invalid addresses receiving deterministic decoy data

### 5.3 Decoy Data Generation

When invalid addresses are requested:

```rust
// Storage provider generates decoy data
decoy_seed = "invalid_content_address:" + requested_address
decoy_size = generate_deterministic_random_size(decoy_seed)
decoy_data = generate_decoy_data(decoy_seed, decoy_size)
return decoy_data  // Appears identical to real encrypted data with realistic size
```

## 6. Security Analysis

### 6.1 Threat Model

**Assets Protected:**
- Content confidentiality (file data)
- Content existence (which files are stored)
- Access patterns (which content is accessed)
- Publisher identity (who stored what content)

**Threat Actors:**
- **Honest-but-Curious Storage Providers**: Follow protocol but attempt to learn information
- **Malicious Storage Providers**: Actively attempt to extract information or censor content
- **Network Observers**: Monitor traffic patterns and request/response sizes
- **Attackers with Partial Information**: Have some URNs but not public keys, or vice versa

### 6.2 Security Properties

#### 6.2.1 Content Confidentiality
- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM with URN-derived keys
- **Key Isolation**: Each URN has unique encryption key
- **Forward Security**: Compromising one key doesn't affect others

#### 6.2.2 Address Unlinkability
- **Transformation**: Storage addresses cannot be linked to original URNs
- **Publisher Separation**: Different public keys create different address spaces
- **Collision Resistance**: Cryptographically unlikely address collisions

#### 6.2.3 Access Indistinguishability
- **No Error Responses**: Invalid requests return data, not errors
- **Deterministic Decoys**: Same invalid request always returns same decoy
- **Size Consistency**: Decoy data matches expected content sizes

### 6.3 Attack Resistance

#### 6.3.1 Enumeration Attacks
**Attack**: Adversary attempts to discover valid content by probing addresses

**Defense**: 
- Invalid addresses return plausible decoy data
- No timing differences between valid/invalid requests
- Decoy data is cryptographically indistinguishable from real encrypted content

#### 6.3.2 Traffic Analysis
**Attack**: Adversary analyzes request patterns and response sizes

**Defense**:
- All responses return data (no error patterns)
- Decoy data sizes match real content patterns
- Request patterns reveal no information about content existence

#### 6.3.3 Partial Information Attacks
**Attack**: Adversary has URN but not public key, or public key but not URN

**Defense**:
- Both URN and public key required for address transformation
- Partial information yields completely different addresses
- No partial success possible

## 7. Implementation Details

### 7.1 Storage Format

**Archive Structure:**
```
{storage_address}.dig:
├── Archive Header (64 bytes)
├── Layer Index (variable)
└── Encrypted Layer Data (AES-256-GCM encrypted)
```

**Layer Encryption:**
- Each layer encrypted using chunk-specific URNs
- Chunk URN format: `urn:dig:chia:{store_id}/chunk/{chunk_hash}`
- Independent encryption keys for each chunk

### 7.2 CLI Interface

**Key Generation:**
```bash
digstore keygen "urn:dig:chia:STORE_ID/file.txt" --json
```

**Storage:**
```bash
digstore config crypto.public_key "hex_public_key"
# Note: encrypted_storage is always enabled by default
digstore add file.txt
digstore commit -m "Store encrypted content"
```

**Retrieval:**
```bash
digstore get file.txt -o encrypted.bin     # Returns encrypted data
digstore decrypt encrypted.bin --urn "urn:dig:chia:STORE_ID/file.txt"
```

### 7.3 Zero-Knowledge Behavior

**Invalid URN Requests:**
```bash
# Invalid store ID
digstore get "urn:dig:chia:0000...0000/file.txt"
# Returns: Realistic-sized deterministic random data (e.g., 47KB, 2.3MB, 89MB, etc.)

# Invalid file path  
digstore get "urn:dig:chia:VALID_STORE/nonexistent.txt"
# Returns: Realistic-sized deterministic random data (e.g., 15KB, 1.7MB, 156MB, etc.)

# Malformed URN
digstore get "invalid-urn-format"  
# Returns: Realistic-sized deterministic random data (e.g., 234KB, 8.9MB, 42MB, etc.)
```

**Content Address Behavior:**
- Invalid transformed addresses return fake layer data
- Fake layers contain plausible-looking encrypted chunks
- Same invalid address always returns same fake layer

## 10. Security Proofs and Analysis

### 10.1 Zero-Knowledge Property

**Theorem**: Storage providers cannot distinguish between valid and invalid content requests with probability better than random guessing.

**Proof Sketch**:
1. Invalid requests return deterministic random data
2. Random data is computationally indistinguishable from encrypted content
3. No timing or size differences between valid/invalid responses
4. Storage provider's view is identical for both cases

### 10.2 Content Privacy

**Theorem**: Storage providers cannot decrypt content without knowledge of the original URN.

**Proof Sketch**:
1. Content encrypted with AES-256-GCM using URN-derived keys
2. Storage provider only sees transformed addresses (not URNs)
3. Reversing address transformation requires private key (not available to storage provider)
4. Encryption key derivation requires original URN (not available to storage provider)

### 10.3 Publisher Unlinkability

**Theorem**: Storage providers cannot correlate content from the same publisher across different public keys.

**Proof Sketch**:
1. Different public keys produce cryptographically independent address spaces
2. Address transformation is one-way (computationally irreversible)
3. No shared metadata or patterns between different public key spaces
4. Publisher identity is never transmitted to storage provider
