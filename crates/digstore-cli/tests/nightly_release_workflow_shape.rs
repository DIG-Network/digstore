//! Shape guard for the professional nightlies release system (dig_ecosystem #590/#592).
//!
//! This repo's release orchestrator (`nightly-release.yml`) is copied from the ecosystem's
//! REFERENCE nightlies implementation (DIG-Network/dig-updater) and has a precise, load-bearing
//! shape. These tests pin that shape so a careless edit — or a copy that drifts — cannot silently
//! revert the repo to the old "tag-and-release-on-every-merge" model:
//!
//!   1. The tagger NO LONGER triggers on push-to-main (the whole point of #590 — releases
//!      are batched to a nightly cron + manual dispatch instead of firing per merge).
//!   2. It DOES trigger on a midnight-UTC `schedule` cron and on `workflow_dispatch`.
//!   3. The STABLE channel keeps its idempotency keystone: skip cutting `vX.Y.Z` when that
//!      tag already exists (an unchanged version = the tag exists = a no-op).
//!   4. The NIGHTLY channel publishes a `prerelease: true` GitHub release under BOTH a dated
//!      `nightly-YYYYMMDD` tag and a force-moved rolling `nightly` tag, is never marked
//!      `latest`, and prunes old dated nightlies down to a retention window.
//!   5. Both channels preserve the RELEASE_TOKEN posture: no token configured => a clean
//!      no-op with a warning, never a half-release.
//!
//! The guard reads the workflow as text (not a YAML parser) on purpose: the invariants are
//! about the literal trigger/step shape a maintainer reads, and a text guard has no external
//! dependency and fails with a message that points at the exact line to fix.
