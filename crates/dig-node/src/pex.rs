//! L7 Peer Exchange (PEX, #166) — the continuous node↔node peer-sharing layer.
//!
//! This is the dig-nat-mux I/O adapter around the transport-agnostic, sans-IO [`dig_pex::PexEngine`]
//! (dig-pex `SPEC.md` §10.1 + Appendix A). It formalizes what the ad-hoc `dig.getPeers` polling did:
//! over each ESTABLISHED mTLS peer connection the node holds, a dedicated **PEX logical stream** on the
//! yamux mux exchanges delta-based **first-hand** known-peer sets (`pex_handshake` → `pex_snapshot` →
//! periodic `pex_delta`s), feeding discovered peers into the dig-gossip pool as **dial candidates**
//! (hints, verified by dialing — never trusted facts) and penalizing peers that misbehave.
//!
//! ## How the engine is embedded
//!
//! One [`PexEngine`](dig_pex::PexEngine) per node, wrapped in [`PexEngineHandle`] (an async-safe
//! `Arc<Mutex<…>>` that also owns a per-link outbound channel registry so the periodic
//! [`tick`](PexEngineHandle::tick) can route each link's `pex_delta` to the task writing that link's
//! stream). The four engine inputs map to four adapters:
//!
//! - **link events** — a connection's [`run_send_direction`] calls `link_up` (emitting our
//!   handshake+snapshot) on start; the connection driver calls `link_down` on close (SPEC §5.5).
//! - **inbound messages** — [`serve_inbound_stream`] decodes framed [`PexMessage`]s off the peer's PEX
//!   stream and feeds `on_message`, writing any `pex_error` replies back on the SAME stream (SPEC
//!   §10.1) and acting on the returned events.
//! - **local peer-set changes** — [`spawn_pool_feeder`] mirrors dig-gossip pool churn
//!   (`connected_pool_peers` + `subscribe_pool_events`) into `upsert_known` / `remove_known`, so the
//!   node advertises exactly its first-hand connected peers (SPEC §9.3 outbound).
//! - **clock ticks** — [`run_tick_loop`] drives `tick` ~1/s.
//!
//! And the two engine outputs map to the pool:
//!
//! - [`PexEvent::Candidates`](dig_pex::PexEvent::Candidates) → [`PexPool::offer_candidates`] — the
//!   production [`GossipPexPool`] dials+verifies each candidate over dig-nat and adopts the verified
//!   connection into the pool (the trust model: a PEX entry is a HINT, proven only by a completed mTLS
//!   handshake — SPEC §11.1). Never marked reachable on the entry alone.
//! - [`PexEvent::Violation`](dig_pex::PexEvent::Violation) `{ mute: true }` → [`PexPool::penalize`] —
//!   the misbehaving peer is disconnected (a version/network mismatch, code 2/5, is benign and does
//!   NOT tear down the connection — SPEC §5.2).
//!
//! ## Relationship to the existing discovery
//!
//! PEX is ADDITIVE and complements the relay introducer + `dig.getPeers`: the introducer/`getPeers`
//! give one-shot snapshots; PEX is the STANDING exchange that keeps address books warm without polling.
//! `dig.getPeers` (the observability/interop surface in [`crate::peer`]) is unchanged and still served
//! — PEX feeds the same pool it reads.
//!
//! ## Where it runs (and the outbound-session seam)
//!
//! PEX runs over the mTLS peer connections THIS node owns — the accepted connections of the peer-RPC
//! listener ([`crate::peer::serve_peer_rpc_listener_with`]). Over one accepted yamux connection BOTH
//! PEX directions run: we open our outbound PEX stream to write our direction, and we accept the peer's
//! PEX stream to read theirs. The in-process FFI path opens no peer network, so it runs no PEX.
//!
//! NOTE (seam for a follow-up): dig-gossip owns the node's OUTBOUND pool sessions internally and does
//! not surface them, so PEX cannot open a stream on a link WE dialed until dig-gossip exposes those
//! sessions (or an accept hook). Until then, PEX rides the accepted (inbound) links; in a mesh where
//! peers dial each other bidirectionally this covers every pair. The advertise set is still fed from
//! the FULL pool (both directions) via [`spawn_pool_feeder`], so what we advertise is complete.
//!
//! There is no `crate::dig-node/SPEC.md` yet (the #167 spec-sweep is paused); this module doc-comment
//! is the interim normative note for the PEX peer-sharing behavior.
