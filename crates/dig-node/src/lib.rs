//! dig-node — the DIG Browser's local node sidecar.
//!
//! A loopback JSON-RPC server implementing the SAME `dig.getContent` contract as
//! rpc.dig.net, but LOCAL-FIRST: a `dig://` request is served from a locally
//! cached `.dig` store module (via `digstore_host::serve_blind`, which
//! instantiates the compiled module and returns a `ContentResponse` =
//! ciphertext + merkle proof + chunk_lens), and only on a cache miss is it
//! proxied to rpc.dig.net. The browser points its dig handler at this node, so
//! once a store is cached locally every resource in it is served without leaving
//! the machine. Cached store modules are evicted with an LRU size cap (default
//! 1 GiB).
//!
//! Native Rust so the compiled-module serve path (BLS, wasmtime) works.
//!
//! Cache layout: `<cache_dir>/<store_id_hex>/<root_hex>.module` — the compiled
//! module bytes for that store at that root. The browser sends a concrete root
//! (rootless URNs are resolved to the singleton tip by dig-resolver first), so a
//! module is keyed by (store_id, root).
//!
//! Authenticated whole-store sync (§21.9): on a local cache miss for a concrete
//! (store, root), the node fetches the WHOLE `.dig` module from rpc.dig.net's §21
//! `GET /stores/{id}/module` endpoint and caches it, then serves every subsequent
//! resource in that store locally. That endpoint is dighub-auth gated (it 401s for
//! anonymous clients), so the node carries a native Chia identity signer (paper
//! §21.9): it stamps `X-Dig-Identity/-Timestamp/-Nonce/-Auth` on the request using
//! the SAME persistent identity key the digstore CLI uses
//! ([`digstore_remote::identity`]). The signer is best-effort — if no identity key
//! is available the node simply skips the authenticated sync and falls back to the
//! per-resource proxy below, so it still serves whatever modules are already
//! present (e.g. the user's own digstore stores) and proxies the rest.
