//! L7 content-location DHT (PHASE-B, #163) — the node uses a Kademlia DHT to LOCATE which peers hold
//! content, and keeps its OWN held-inventory provider records CURRENT in the DHT.
//!
//! This layer sits ON TOP of the phase-2b peer network ([`crate::peer`]): the DHT rides the SAME
//! dig-nat mTLS transport the peer RPC uses (peer_id = SHA-256(TLS SPKI DER)), so there is no
//! unauthenticated DHT traffic. It composes three things dig-dht ([`dig_dht`]) leaves to the node:
//!
//! 1. **A [`DhtTransport`] over dig-nat** ([`NatDhtTransport`]): "send this [`DhtRequest`] to that
//!    peer, give me the [`DhtResponse`]." It dials a peer over dig-nat's NAT-traversal ladder (mTLS,
//!    peer_id pinned), opens ONE logical stream, writes `request.encode()`, reads `DhtResponse::decode`,
//!    bounded by an RPC timeout, mapping every failure to [`DhtError::transport`] (which the lookup
//!    treats as "that peer is unreachable" and moves on).
//! 2. **Bring-up + maintenance** ([`DhtHandle`], [`run_maintenance`]): construct a [`DhtService`] for
//!    this node (the standalone `run()` path wires it in [`crate::peer`]'s peer-network bring-up),
//!    bootstrap it from the dig-gossip peer pool + the relay introducer as [`BootstrapPeer`]s
//!    ([`bootstrap_peers_from_pool`]), then run the periodic maintenance loop (`republish` /
//!    `refresh_buckets` / `gc`) so provider records never lapse and the routing table stays fresh.
//! 3. **Inventory publishing** (the emphasized requirement): the node continuously keeps its provider
//!    records current — [`announce_inventory`] on startup for every held capsule (at store AND
//!    root/capsule granularity), [`sync_inventory`] on inventory change (announce new content,
//!    withdraw removed content), `republish()` before TTL via the maintenance loop, and a best-effort
//!    `withdraw_provider` sweep on graceful shutdown.
//!
//! ## Serving the inbound DHT RPC
//!
//! A node is both a DHT client and a DHT server. Inbound DHT logical streams are dispatched (by the
//! peer-RPC listener in [`crate::peer`]) to [`DhtService::handle_request_from`], passing the
//! mTLS-verified caller [`Contact`] so the routing table populates bidirectionally the way Kademlia
//! tables fill. This module owns the classification ([`is_dht_request`]) + the caller construction
//! ([`caller_contact`]) that the listener uses.
//!
//! ## The clean seam for #164 (dig-download)
//!
//! [`DhtHandle::locate_providers`] answers "who holds this ContentId?" by running `find_providers` and
//! returning the live [`ProviderRecord`]s; [`availability_item_for`] turns a located capsule
//! ContentId into the [`AvailabilityItem`] a finder confirms against a provider before fetching. That
//! is the clean locate→provider→availability→fetch seam the full multi-source range orchestration
//! (#164 dig-download) consumes — it takes exactly this provider set.
