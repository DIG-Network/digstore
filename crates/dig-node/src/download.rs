//! P2P content orchestration — dig-download as the node's multi-source content-FETCH path (#164)
//! and REDIRECT-ON-MISS (#165).
//!
//! This module is the final wire-up of the DIG Node P2P content epic. It composes the pieces the
//! earlier phases left as seams:
//!
//! 1. **The fetch path (#164)** — [`NodeContent`] builds a [`dig_download::Downloader`] from the
//!    node's LIVE runtime pieces exactly as dig-download's implementers' note prescribes:
//!    [`DhtProviderLocator`] over the node's [`dig_dht::DhtService`] (the locate seam
//!    [`crate::dht::DhtHandle::locate_providers`] pointed at), [`NatRangeTransport`] over the node's
//!    mTLS identity + NAT config + network id, [`MerkleVerifier::with_proof_verifier`] bound to the
//!    **digstore** merkle-proof byte format ([`DigstoreProofVerifier`] — the store crate owns the
//!    proof encoding, so the whole-resource check binds to the chain-anchored root), a per-download
//!    [`FileSink`] staging under the node's cache, and a [`FileStateStore`] so interrupted downloads
//!    resume. [`NodeContent::fetch_resource`] is the content-acquisition entry point: derive the
//!    [`ContentId`], `download(...)`, drive progress, and land the verified bytes in the node
//!    (in-memory, served like a locally-held resource). Stale `.download.tmp` staging files are
//!    reaped by [`NodeContent::spawn_gc`] (startup sweep + interval, like the DHT gc/republish loop).
//!
//! 2. **Redirect-on-miss (#165)** — when a content RPC (`dig.getContent` / `dig.fetchRange` / the
//!    peer range stream / `dig.getAvailability`) asks for content this node does NOT hold, the miss
//!    handler ([`crate::Node::miss_outcome`]) locates the holders via the DHT and — by default —
//!    RETURNS A REDIRECT naming them ([`CONTENT_REDIRECT`], JSON-RPC error `-32008` whose
//!    `data.redirect` carries the providers' `peer_id` + candidate addresses), so the caller
//!    re-requests against a holder instead of dead-ending on a bare not-found. Hops are BOUNDED: the
//!    caller echoes `redirect_depth` on the re-request and a node at/over [`REDIRECT_HOP_CAP`]
//!    answers the plain not-found (no redirect loops). With `DIG_NODE_ON_MISS=fetch` the node
//!    instead FETCHES-THROUGH: it pulls the resource from the holders via dig-download (multi-source,
//!    verified), caches it, and serves it directly — and if the fetch fails it still falls back to
//!    the redirect, so a provider-held resource is never silently 404'd.
//!
//! The engine is constructed ONLY by the standalone peer-network bring-up
//! ([`crate::peer::spawn_peer_network`]); the in-process FFI path (the browser) never sets it, so
//! every existing hit path — local module serve, §21 sync, response cache, upstream proxy — and the
//! FFI contract are byte-identical to before (the miss handler is a no-op without the engine).
