# Requirements Summary

This document summarizes how Digstore Min addresses all specified requirements.

## Core Requirements Addressed

### 1. ✅ No Encryption, Privacy, or Blockchain
- Simplified architecture without encryption layers
- No privacy obfuscation or decoy operations
- No blockchain integration or anchoring
- Focus on core content-addressable storage

### 2. ✅ Root Hash Representation
- Every repository has a root hash representing all data
- Root hash is the merkle root of all layer hashes
- Updated with each new layer (generation)
- Stored in Layer 0 for easy access

### 3. ✅ Comprehensive Merkle Proofs
- Generate proofs for any single data item
- Support proofs for arbitrary byte ranges
- Prove entire layers against root hash
- Standard proof format for interoperability

### 4. ✅ URN-Based Data Extraction
- Layer format designed for streaming extraction
- Index section enables fast lookups
- Chunk-based storage for efficient retrieval
- Direct access by URN without full layer parsing

### 5. ✅ Extended URN with Byte Ranges
- Format: `urn:dig:chia:{storeID}[:{rootHash}][/{path}][#{byteRange}]`
- Supports standard HTTP byte range syntax
- Examples:
  - `#bytes=0-1023` (first 1KB)
  - `#bytes=1024-` (from 1KB to end)
  - `#bytes=-1024` (last 1KB)

### 6. ✅ Diff-Optimized Layer System
- Full layers: Complete repository snapshots
- Delta layers: Only store changes
- Content-defined chunking for deduplication
- Files can span multiple layers efficiently
- Automatic delta chain limiting

### 7. ✅ Layer 0 Header Information
- Special metadata layer always at `0000000000000000.layer`
- Contains:
  - Store ID
  - Creation timestamp
  - Format version
  - Complete root history
  - Repository configuration

### 8. ✅ 32-Byte Random Store ID
- Generated using cryptographically secure RNG
- Hex-encoded for filesystem compatibility (64 chars)
- Used as:
  - Directory name
  - URN component
  - Unique repository identifier

### 9. ✅ Root History Tracking
- Every generation recorded in Layer 0
- Includes:
  - Generation number
  - Root hash
  - Timestamp
  - Layer count
- Enables retrieval at any historical state

### 10. ✅ Historical State Retrieval
- URN supports optional root hash component
- Default to latest if not specified
- Example: `urn:dig:chia:STORE:ROOT_HASH/file.txt`
- Complete reconstruction from any generation

### 11. ✅ Single Portable Layer Files
- Each layer is self-contained
- Binary format with header, index, data sections
- Include all necessary metadata
- Can be verified independently

### 12. ✅ Easy Transfer Between Computers
- Repository data in `~/.dig/{store_id}` directory
- Copy store directory from `~/.dig/` to transfer
- Projects use portable `.digstore` file
- Device-agnostic mode avoids absolute paths
- Platform independent

### Additional: ✅ Simplified CLI Usage
- When in project directory with `.digstore` file:
  - Can use `/path/to/file` instead of full URN
  - Store ID automatically read from `.digstore`
  - Example: `digstore get /src/main.rs`
- Full URN still works from anywhere

### 13. ✅ Streaming Data by URN
- Efficient chunk-based retrieval
- Support for partial file access
- Memory-mapped file support
- Parallel chunk reading
- Minimal memory overhead

## Additional Features Implemented

### Data Integrity
- SHA-256 hashing throughout
- Layer-level integrity checks
- File-level hash verification
- Chunk-level deduplication

### Performance Optimizations
- Index caching in memory
- Lazy layer loading
- Parallel processing support
- Optional compression

### Developer Experience
- Git-like CLI commands
- Comprehensive error messages
- Detailed documentation
- Clean API design

## Architecture Benefits

### Simplicity
- No complex encryption schemes
- Straightforward layer format
- Clear separation of concerns
- Minimal dependencies

### Portability
- Pure Rust implementation
- Cross-platform support
- No external services required
- Self-contained repositories

### Extensibility
- Pluggable storage backends
- Configurable chunking strategies
- Optional compression algorithms
- Future-proof versioning
