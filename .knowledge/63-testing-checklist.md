## Critical Root Cause Analysis

### 🔴 PRIMARY ISSUE: Root Tracking Failure
**Evidence:**
- Status shows "Current commit: none (no commits yet)" after successful commit
- Log shows "No commits found" 
- Get command returns "File not found" for committed files

**Root Cause:** 
The `update_root_history()` method or root persistence is not working correctly in the archive format.

**Impact:** 
This breaks 10+ commands that depend on proper root tracking and committed data access.

## Detailed Fix and Test Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Root Tracking (🔴 CRITICAL)
- [ ] **Fix `update_root_history()` method**
  - Debug why root history is not being persisted
  - Ensure Layer 0 metadata is properly updated in archive
  - Verify current_root is properly set and persisted

- [ ] **Fix `load_current_root_from_archive()` method**
  - Ensure root is properly loaded when Store opens
  - Verify archive Layer 0 reading works correctly
  - Test root persistence across CLI command invocations

- [ ] **Add Root Tracking Tests**
  - Test commit updates root correctly
  - Test root persists across Store instances
  - Test root history is properly maintained
  - Test current_root is correctly loaded

### Phase 2: Fix Data Access Commands (🔴 HIGH)
- [ ] **Fix `get` command**
  - Ensure it can find files in committed layers
  - Test file retrieval from archive
  - Add comprehensive get command tests

- [ ] **Fix `cat` command**  
  - Ensure it can display committed file contents
  - Test content display functionality
  - Add cat command tests

- [ ] **Fix `log` command**
  - Ensure it shows commit history correctly
  - Test log formatting and data display
  - Add log command tests

- [ ] **Fix `info` command**
  - Ensure it shows repository information correctly
  - Test info data gathering and display
  - Add info command tests

### Phase 3: Fix Analysis Commands (🟡 MEDIUM)
- [ ] **Fix `root` command**
  - Ensure it shows current root correctly
  - Test root information display
  - Add root command tests

- [ ] **Fix `history` command**
  - Ensure it shows root history correctly
  - Test history analysis and display
  - Add history command tests

- [ ] **Fix `size` command**
  - Ensure storage analytics work with archive format
  - Test size calculations and display
  - Add size command tests

- [ ] **Fix `store-info` command**
  - Ensure store information gathering works
  - Test store info display
  - Add store-info command tests

- [ ] **Fix `stats` command**
  - Ensure repository statistics work correctly
  - Test stats gathering and display
  - Add stats command tests

### Phase 4: Fix Advanced Commands (🟡 MEDIUM)
- [ ] **Fix `layers` command**
  - Ensure layer analysis works with archive format
  - Test layer enumeration and analysis
  - Add layers command tests

- [ ] **Fix `inspect` command**
  - Ensure deep layer inspection works
  - Test layer inspection functionality
  - Add inspect command tests

- [ ] **Fix `prove` command**
  - Ensure proof generation works with committed data
  - Test proof generation for files and byte ranges
  - Add prove command tests

- [ ] **Fix `verify` command**
  - Ensure proof verification works correctly
  - Test proof verification functionality
  - Add verify command tests

## Test Coverage Requirements

### Integration Tests
- [ ] **End-to-end workflow tests**
  - init → add → commit → get → log workflow
  - Multiple commit cycles
  - Root tracking across CLI invocations

- [ ] **Command interaction tests**
  - Commands work correctly after commits
  - Data persists between command invocations
  - Archive format compatibility

### Unit Tests for Each Fixed Command
- [ ] **Positive test cases** (normal operation)
- [ ] **Negative test cases** (error conditions)
- [ ] **Edge cases** (empty repositories, large data, etc.)
- [ ] **Regression prevention** (specific bugs found during fixing)

### Performance Tests
- [ ] **Command performance** under load
- [ ] **Large repository handling**
- [ ] **Memory usage validation**

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] All 19 commands execute without errors
- [ ] Commands show correct data and output
- [ ] Proper error handling for invalid inputs
- [ ] Consistent behavior across all commands

### Quality Requirements  
- [ ] 100% test coverage for all fixed commands
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for critical commands
- [ ] Regression tests prevent future breakage
- [ ] Documentation updated for any changes

## Current Status
- **Staging System**: ✅ 100% Working (user requirements fulfilled)
- **Archive Integration**: ❌ Needs fixes (root tracking and data access)
- **Test Coverage**: 🔄 In Progress (staging tests complete, command tests needed)

## Priority Order
1. 🔴 **CRITICAL**: Fix root tracking (enables 10+ commands)
2. 🔴 **HIGH**: Fix data access commands (get, cat, log, info)
3. 🟡 **MEDIUM**: Fix analysis commands (root, history, size, store-info, stats)
4. 🟡 **MEDIUM**: Fix advanced commands (layers, inspect, prove, verify)
5. ✅ **COMPLETE**: Add comprehensive test coverage for all fixes
