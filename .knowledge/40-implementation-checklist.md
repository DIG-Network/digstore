2. **Test Early**: Write tests as you implement each component
3. **Iterative Development**: Get basic functionality working before optimizing
4. **Error Handling**: Use Result<T, E> throughout, avoid unwrap() in production
5. **Documentation**: Document as you code, not after
6. **Performance**: Profile before optimizing, focus on correctness first
